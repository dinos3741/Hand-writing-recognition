# Hand-writing-recognition
Hand written digits recognition in Python using a scikit-learn classification neural network. For simplicity, the bit-depth of the digits is binary (no greyscale). The input frame is the classical 28x28 NMIST frame, and the training set was the 60,000 hand-written MNIST digits, transformed to binary form. 
There is also a version where I implement a multi-perceptor neural network from scratch, but with poorer results.
